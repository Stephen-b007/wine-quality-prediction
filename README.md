# wine-quality-prediction
This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict wine quality based on its chemical properties. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualizations. The goal is to classify wines as 'good' or 'bad' using a threshold score of 6 or higher.
